                   My name is Crissa Aperin Olavario, an eighteen-year-old teenager. I was born in Bonga, Bacacay, Albay on the 9th day of June 2002. I am a resident of Zone 3 Bonga, Bacacay, Albay. 
                    My father is Nomer V. Olavario. He holds a degree as a Registered Master Electrician (RME) and currently working as a foreman electrician in Tacloban. My mother is Maria A. Olavario, and she is a store owner here in Bonga. They were both 44 years old.  I have three siblings, Mary Joy, Khate, and Reymond. Mary Joy, our elder sister. She is currently studying at Bicol University Tabaco Campus. Next to me is Khate, a grade 7 student. Then, Reymond, a grade 4 student.
                    I am a daughter, sister, friend, student, and also a dreamer. I dream of being an IT Professional someday. That's why, aside from graduating from Senior High School with honors, I also considered that being able to pass the Bicol University College Entrance Test (BUCET) was one of my achievements, which is probably the first step for me to achieve my dreams and goals.  Other than that, I also dream of graduating with the degree of my chosen career. The reason why I keep on striving, even though sometimes it seems so hard for me to cope up with these things.
